/*
 * The Base Address Register provides automatic hardware Address relocation and
 * Address range limitation when the processor is in BAR mode.
 *
 * BAR.BASE: Contains the 9 high-order bits of an 18-bit address relocation
 * constant. The low-order bits are generated as zeros.
 *
 * BAR.BOUND: Contains the 9 high-order bits of the unrelocated address limit.
 * The low- order bits are generated as zeros. An attempt to access main memory
 * beyond this limit causes a store fault, out of bounds. A value of 0 is truly
 * 0, indicating a null memory range.
 * 
 * In BAR mode, the base address register (BAR) is used. The BAR contains an
 * address bound and a base address. All computed addresses are relocated by
 * adding the base address. The relocated address is combined with the
 * procedure pointer register to form the virtual memory address. A program is
 * kept within certain limits by subtracting the unrelocated computed address
 * from the address bound. If the result is zero or negative, the relocated
 * address is out of range, and a store fault occurs.
