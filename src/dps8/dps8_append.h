//! Appending unit stuff .......

//Once segno and offset are formed in TPR.SNR and TPR.CA, respectively, the process of generating the 24-bit absolute main memory address can involve a number of different and distinct appending unit cycles.
//The operation of the appending unit is shown in the flowchart in Figure 5-4. This flowchart assumes that directed faults, store faults, and parity faults do not occur.
//A segment boundary check is made in every cycle except PSDW. If a boundary violation is detected, an access violation, out of segment bounds, fault is generated and the execution of the instruction interrupted. The occurrence of any fault interrupts the sequence at the point of occurrence. The operating system software should store the control unit data for possible later continuation and attempt to resolve the fault condition.
//The value of the associative memories may be seen in the flowchart by observing the number of appending unit cycles bypassed if an SDW or PTW is found in the associative memories.
//There are nine different appending unit cycles that involve accesses to main memory. Two of these (FANP, FAP) generate the 24-bit absolute main memory address and initiate a main memory access for the operand, indirect word, or instruction pair; five (NSDW, PSDW, PTW, PTW2, and DSPTW) generate a main memory access to fetch an SDW or PTW; and two (MDSPTW and MPTW) generate a main memory access to update page status bits (PTW.U and PTW.M) in a PTW. The cycles are defined in Table 5-1.

                // Fetches the next PTW from a page table other than a descriptor segment page table during hardware prepaging for certain uninterruptible EIS instructions. This cycle does not load the next PTW into the appending unit. It merely assures that the PTW is not faulted (PTW.F = 1) and that the target page will be in main memory when and if needed by the instruction.
    DSPTW,      ///< Descriptor segment PTW fetch
                // Fetches a PTW from a descriptor segment page table.
    MDSPTW,     ///< Modify DSPTW
                // Sets the page accessed bit (PTW.U) in the PTW for a page in a descriptor segment page table. This cycle always immediately follows a DSPTW cycle.
    MPTW        ///< Modify PTW
                //Sets the page modified bit (PTW.M) in the PTW for a page in other than a descriptor segment page table.
