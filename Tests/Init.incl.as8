" The trap causes the forced execution of a pair of instructions in a main memory location, unique to the fault or interrupt, known as the fault or interrupt vector. The first of the forced instructions may cause safe storage of the processor status. The second instruction in a fault vector should be some form of transfer, or the faulting program will be resumed at the point of interruption.
