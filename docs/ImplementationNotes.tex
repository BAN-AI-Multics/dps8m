\section{SCU}

From the Multicians' Multics Glossary:

\begin{quote}
SCU

[BSG] (1) System Control Unit, or Memory Controller. The multiported, 
arbitrating interface to each bank of memory (usually 128 or 256 KWords), each
port connecting to a port of an "active device" (CPU, GIOC or IOM, bulk store
or drum controller). On the 645, the clock occupied an SCU as well. The SCUs
have their own repertoire of opcodes and registers, including those by which
system interrupts are set by one active unit for another. (See connect.) The
flexibility of this architecture was significant among the reasons why the GE
600 line was chosen for Multics. See SCAS.

SCAS

[BSG] (for "System Controller Addressing Segment") A supervisor segment with
one page in the memory space described by each SCU (or other passive module) in
the system. The SCAS contains no data, is not demand-paged, and its page table
is not managed by page control. Instructions directed specifically to an SCU as
opposed to the memory it controls are issued to absolute addresses in the SCAS
through pointers (in the SCS) calculated during initialization precisely to
this end. Typical of such instructions are cioc (issue a connect), smic (set an
interrupt), and the instructions to read and set SCU registers (including
interrupt masks). On the 6180, rccl (the instruction to read the SCU-resident
calendar clock) did not require an absolute address, but a port number,
obviating the need for the SCAS to be visible outside ring 0 to support user
clock-reading as had been the case on the 645. The SCAS, which is a segment but
not a data base, is an example of exploiting the paging mechanism for a purpose
other than implementing virtual memory.

connect

[BSG] Communication signal sent from one active device to another. When
received by a processor, as polled for the control unit after each instruction
pair like an interrupt, a special fault (connect fault), very much like an
interrupt, is taken. As with interrupts, processors send "connects" to each
other through the SCU, the only possible channel. While an interrupt is set in
an SCU register and fielded by the first "taker" of all appropriately masked
CPUs, a connect fault is routed by the SCU to one, specified processor (or I/O
controller), and cannot be masked against (although the recipient's inhibit bit
can postpone it for a short while). Sending a connect to the GIOC or IOM was
the way of instructing it to begin executing I/O commands. See SCAS.

Multics uses connects for forcing all CPUs to take note of SDW and PTW
invalidation (and clear their associative memories and execute a partial cache
clear when appropriate), holding CPUs in the air during critical phases of
dynamic reconfiguration, and the like. If my memory serves me well, functions
such as system crashing, scheduler preemption, and processor startup switched
back and forth between software-generated interrupts and connects throughout
the '70s.
\end {quote}

According to AL39, a DPS 8M supports only 2 SCUs.

The code base currently abstracts away the SCUs, but they are being implemented.


\begin{itemize}

\item The clock is implemented as a seperate SIMH device.

\item The CPU connects directly to the IOMs. Being fixed.

\item Memory is implemented a a single, device independent model.

\item The SIMH CPU device only supports single CPUs currently, so the CPU to CPU communication issues are ignored for now. To get proper mult-CPU support, the SCU will probably need to be reallzed.
\end {itemize}

\section {IOM}

[cac] The reference document I have been using is 43A239854 ENGINEERING PRODUCT PECIFICATION, PART 1 6000B INPUT/OUT MULTIPLEXER (IOM) CENTRAL

The IOM model abstracts away controller devices such as the MPC. This means the
IOM code is very device aware, including extracting dev\_code values to enable
routing of connections. Unfortunately, this complexity leads to bugs relating
to the confusion of dev\_codes with SIMH UNIT numbers. Adding MPC devices would
isolate the complexities of dev\_code handling from the complexities of
connection handling, is probably a good idea.

\section {Tape}

The device seems good to go; it is a very abstract model, with no hardware modeling beyond a tracking a virtual cable to a port on an IOM.

\section {Disk}

Existing code base is skeletal.

\section {CPU}

AL39 "Interrupt Sampling"

"The processor always fetches intructions in pairs. At an appropriate point
(as early as possible) in the execution of a pair of instructions, the
next sequential instruction pair is fetched and held is a special 
instruction buffer register. The exact point depends on instruction
sequence and other conditions.

"If the interrupt inhibit bit (bit 28) is not set in the current instruction
word at the point of next sequential instruction pair virtual address 
formation, te processor samples the group 7 faults [Shutdown, Timer Runout,
Connect]. If any of the group 7 faults is found an internal flag is set
reflecting the presence of a fault. The processor next samples the interrupt
present lines from all eight memory interface posts and loads a register
with bits corresponding to the states of the lines. If any bit in the
register is set ON an internal flag is set to reflect te presence of the
bit(s) in the register.

"If the instruction pair virtual address being formed is the result of a
transfer of control condition or if the current instruction is Execute (xec), * Execute Double (xed), Repeat (rpt), Repeat Double (rpd), or Repeat Link
(rpl), the group 7 faults and interrupt present lines are not sampled.

"At an appropriate point in the execution of the current instruction pair,
the process fetches he next instruction pair. At this point, it first tests
the internal flags for group 7 faults and interupts. If either flag is set
it does not fetch the next instruction pair.

"At the completion of the current instruction pair the proessor once again
checks the internal flags. If neither flag is set execution of the next
instruction pair proceeds. If the internal flag for group 7 faults is set,
the processor enters a FAULT cycle for the highest priority group 7
fault present. If the internal flag for interrupts s set, the processor
enters an INTERRUPT CYCLE."

\begin {lstlisting}
 bool prefetch_valid = false
 bool out_of_seq = false // set after transfer, execute or repeat

 forever {

     if !prefetch_valid {
         inst_pair_buffer = fetch_pair ()
     }

     inst_pair = inst_pair_buffer
     prefetch_valid = false

     for inst# = 0, 1 {

         // Bug; doesn't handle odd IC on entry

         decode_inst (inst_pair [inst#]   

         if inst# == 0 {
            if !inhibit && !out_of_seq {
                g7_flag = sample_g7_faults ()
                int_flag = sample_interrupts ()
            } else {
                g7_flag = false
                int_flag = false
            }
            if !g7_flag && ! int_flag {
                inst_pair_buffer = fetch_pair ()
                prefetch_valid = true
            }
         }

         execute_decoded_inst ()
         if was_transfer
           break       // don't execute second half after a transfer
     }

     if g7_flag
         enter_fault_cycle ()
     if int_flag
         enter_interrupt_cycle ()
 }
\end{lstlisting}

This is not quite right yet; better integration with the out\_of\_seq
conditions is needed. Perhaps the prefetch test also need an address
check, ie. is the address that was fetched what the processor was
expecting (equal to the Ir).

\para {32 bit support}

The DPS8 is a 36 bit computer, with a double word of 72 bits. In order to 
manipulate these numbers in the assembler and the emulator, int128\_t 
types must be supported by the compiler, or a complex and cumbersome 128 
emulation library is needed.
