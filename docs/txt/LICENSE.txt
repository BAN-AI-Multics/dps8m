 * This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is
   provided and donated to The Massachusetts Institute of Technology by
   Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems, Inc. as a contribution
   to computer science knowledge.

 * This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions
   of The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Laboratories, General
   Electric, Honeywell Information Systems, Inc., Honeywell BULL, Inc.,
   Groupe BULL and BULL HN Information Systems, Inc. to the development of
   this operating system.

 * Multics development was initiated by The Massachusetts Institute of
   Technology Project MAC (1963-1970), renamed the MIT Laboratory for
   Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under
   the leadership of Professor Fernando José Corbató. Users consider that
   Multics provided the best software architecture for managing computer
   hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating
   systems incorporated Multics principles.

 * Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe, and in
   the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems, Inc., as successor in interest
   by change in name only to Honeywell Bull, Inc. and Honeywell Information
   Systems, Inc.
