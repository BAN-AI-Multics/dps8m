\subsection[Central Processing Unit]{CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT}

This section describes the configuration and operation of the simulated DPS8M Central Processing Unit (CPU).

\subsubsection[CPU Overview]{CPU OVERVIEW}

The DPS8M CPU has
\begin{itemize}
	\item 36 bit words
	\item 18 bit addresses (allowing a segment size of 256 thousand words)
	\item 15 bit segment numbers (allowing 32 thousand segments of 256 thousand words)
	\item 1 million instructions per second (1 MIP)
	\item Direct Memory Access I/O (DMA)
	\item Two 36 bit accumulators (A and Q)
	\item Eight 18 bit index registers (X0-X7)
	\item Eight pointer/address registers (each containing a 15 bit segment number, 18 bit address and 6 bit bit number)
	\item 36 and 72 bit integer and floating point arithmetic
	\item 10 digit decimal arithmetic
	\item String move and compare
	\item Decimal number formatting (e.g COBOL or PL/1 "PIC")
\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection[CPU Options]{CPU OPTIONS}

These are the currently supported "normal" CPU options:

faultbase

num

data

stopnum

mode

speed

port

assignment

interlace

enable

init\_enable

store\_size

These options are supported as "hacks" and should not normally be used:

dis\_enable

halt\_on\_unimplemented

disable\_wam

report\_faults

tro\_enable

drl\_fatal

useMap

address

disable\_cache
