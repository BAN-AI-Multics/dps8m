* **DPS8M** is a simulator of the 36‑bit GE Large Systems / Honeywell / Bull 600/6000‑series mainframe computers (Honeywell 6180, Honeywell Series‑60 ∕ Level‑68, and Honeywell ∕ Bull **DPS‑8/M**) descended from the **GE‑645** and engineered to support the [**Multics** operating system](https://swenson.org/multics_wiki/).

* **DPS8M** is [**open source software**](../License_Information) developed by [**The DPS8M Development Team**](https://dps8m.gitlab.io/dps8m/master/dps8m-omnibus.pdf#the-dps8m-development-team) and [many contributors](https://dps8m.gitlab.io/dps8m/master/dps8m-omnibus.pdf#dps8m-authors-and-contributors).

* **DPS8M** supports most <u>operating systems</u> conforming to *IEEE Std 1003.1-2008* (**POSIX.1-2008**), many <u>C compilers</u> conforming to *ISO/IEC 9899:1999* (**C99**), and numerous <u>hardware architectures</u>.

  * <u>Operating systems</u> supported are **AIX**, **FreeBSD**, **NetBSD**, **OpenBSD**, **DragonFly BSD**, **Haiku**, **GNU/Hurd**, **illumos OpenIndiana**, **Linux**, **macOS**, **Solaris**, and **Windows**.

  * <u>C compilers</u> supported are **Clang**, AMD Optimizing C/C++ (**AOCC**), Arm C/C++ Compiler (**ARMClang**), GNU C (**GCC**), IBM Advance Toolchain, IBM XL C/C++ (**XLC**), Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ (**ICX**), and Oracle Developer Studio (**SunCC**).

  * <u>Hardware architectures</u> supported are **Intel x86** (i686, x86_64), **ARM** (ARMv6, ARMv7, ARM64), **PowerPC** (PPC, PPC64, PPC64le), **RISC-V** (RV64), and **m68k** (68020+).

* Various releases of **DPS8M** have been ported to **embedded systems**, **cell phones**, **tablets**, **handheld gaming consoles**, **wireless routers**, and even modern **mainframes**.  A full-featured port should be possible for any 32- or 64-bit platform with hardware atomic operations able to support the [**libuv**](https://libuv.org/) asynchronous I/O library.

* The simulator is distributed as an easy-to-build [**source code distribution**](../Releases) (building simply via **`make`** on most systems) or as ready-to-run [**pre-compiled binaries**](../Releases) for several popular platforms.

* **DPS8M** development is hosted courtesy of [**GitLab**](https://gitlab.com/dps8m/dps8m), providing [version control](https://gitlab.com/dps8m/dps8m), [issue tracking](https://gitlab.com/dps8m/dps8m/-/issues), and [CI/CD services](https://gitlab.com/dps8m/dps8m/-/pipelines).
