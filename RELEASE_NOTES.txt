4Jan14: The ini files were rename to .ini files 
    dps8.ini.20184.tap -> 20184.ini
    dps8.ini.base_system -> base_system.ini
    dps8.ini.t4d_b.2.tap -> t4d_b.2.ini

16Feb14: Many simulator commands have been added or enhanced. The file
         'docs/ImplementationNotes.ps' has been updated to reflect the changes.

15July2014:

  The FXE subsystem requires an installed Multics tape image tree.

  The MR12.3 tree can be found at:

  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxMJyk--V8yWZXJlYWpXTDAzQ28/edit?usp=sharing

  Download the file and untar it in the src/dps8 directory, or whatever
  directory you execute FXE from. The uncompressed tree will occupy ~ 245MB
  of disk space.

27July2014:

  The faults branch can now successfully boot to "bce (boot)". The tarball is
  built from the faults branch.

  Building:

    A 64 bit processor and OS is needed.

    The build environment used by unused0 is:

        Fedora Core 20.
        clang 3.4
        (gcc 4.8 also works)

    The build enviroment used by doon386 is Eclipse, running under MacOS.

  Building from git:

    git checkout fault
    cd src/dps8
    make

  Building from the tarball:

    cd src/dps8
    make

  Booting Multics:

    From the directory src/dps8:

    1). Fetch the Multics tapes:

        make tapes

    2). Format a boot disk

       ./dps8 format.ini

    3). Initialize the RPV with a cold boot:

       ./dps8 cold.ini

    4). Add a config deck

       ./dps8 establish_config_deck.ini

    5). Start "bce(boot)"

       ./dps8 bce.ini

        Use the bce command "die" to exit bce and the emulator.


    Notes:

      The created disk will occupy ~ 1GB of disk space.
      The tape image files will occupy ~ .5 GB of disk space.
